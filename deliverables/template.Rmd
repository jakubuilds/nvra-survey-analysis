# Overview
This is the first heading.  Here I will print a table
```{r table, echo = FALSE}
data("mtcars")
cars <- mtcars[1:10, 1:5]
knitr::kable(cars,
            caption = "Here is a caption")
```

```{r reg, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
fit1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)
fit2 <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, mtcars)
fit3 <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp + disp, mtcars)

star1 <- stargazer::stargazer(fit1, fit2, fit3, type = 'html', digits = 3, out = "models.doc")
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Heading 3
This includes a subheading, where I will try a list:

- Item 
- Item
- Item

I will also try a numbered list:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
